Kailas has since worked in institutions in five countries on a cell phone, an electric-hybrid scooter, and more. But she longed to “have the maximum impact on society”.</p>
                                        <p>Her chance came when she and her partner Nitin Sisodia cofounded Sohum Innovation Lab to develop innovative health-care projects and decided to design a cheap, portable device to screen infants for hearing loss.</p>
